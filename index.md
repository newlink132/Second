     <p> This website, as dull as it is, will be explaining me, who  I am, what I want to do, etc. </p>
  <h3> Who?</h3>
  <p> I live with a small family in a condo, with two small dogs. I live in Orange County, California. I go to the diablo home, <a href= "https://www.svusd.org/schools/high-schools/mission-viejo/about/missionhistory"> Mission Viejo Highschool </a>  <img src= "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ha-oAKfTXFk/Ta-DQUBcAwI/AAAAAAAAAS8/43HNeQhqPas/s1600/MVHS_diablo-smaller.gif" width = "10%"></p>
  <h3> What is Important to me?</h3>
  <p> I spend much of my time on few things~ <ul> 
  <li> School work </li> 
  <li> Community service for the OC Sheriffs' department </li> 
  <li> And as of right now (summer) video games </li> 
   </ul> </p>
     <p> I play sports too, in fact I played soccer for nearly eight years, but After all that time I realized it was not something I enjoyed and I knew that it would not benefit me for the future (I was not good enough to get a scholarship) so I stopped. During highschool years I picked up lacrosse and enjoy the game. <br>
  As I wrote, School work is important to me. Well, my parents, and me. I am in all honors classes, and will be taking the IB program this year. And since I have been strainning to keep all As, I currently am first in my class rank of over 500 people. Yay.
  <br>
  I also do that community service thing- it is called being a part of the Explorers program. I learn about police opperations, workout, and help the community. I do some other community service at school too, but I get most of my hours from the Explorers program.
       <br> <br> And like I said, I paly many video games now,  so I might just make a table... </p>
  <table> <tr> <th> Explore         </th> <th> Indie       </th> <th> Puzzle      </th> <th> Shooting        </th> </tr>
    <tr> <td> |Minecraft </td> <td> 
|de Blob </td> <td> |Death Squared </td> <td> |GTA V </td> </tr> <tr> <td> |Ori </td> <td> |Coffee Talk </td> <td> |Bad North </td> <td> |Apex </td> </tr> <tr> <td> |No Man's Sky</td> <td> |After Party </td> <td> |Human Fall flat </td> <td> |Overwatch </td> </tr>
  </table>
